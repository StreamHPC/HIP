-### Build HIP directed tests
-Developers can build HIP directed tests right after build HIP commands,
+When you add or change a HIP API, you might need to generate a new `hip_prof_str.h` header. This header is used by rocm tools to track HIP APIs like rocprofiler/roctracer etc.
+To generate the header after your change, use the tool `hip_prof_gen.py` present in `hipamd/src`.

+Usage:
